It previously supported only PyTorch, but, as of late 2019, TensorFlow 2 is supported as well. While the library can be used for many tasks from Natural Language Inference (NLI) to Question-Answering, text classification remains one of the most popular and practical use cases.\n\nTransformers (formerly known as pytorch-transformers and pytorch-pretrained-bert) provides general-purpose architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNetâ€¦) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/transformers/"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"7401df88-47ec-4293-8327-a6092746d464"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from transformers import pipeline"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"84cf45fd-68ff-4497-919c-91d18a58966c"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]},"transient":null}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Zero Shot Classification"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"51feeecb-86a7-4dfe-8332-0fb8694438e6"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["classifier = pipeline('zero-shot-classification')"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"eb936867-b58c-4c62-b1aa-3d4fcc61152d"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\">No model was supplied, defaulted to facebook/bart-large-mnli (https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli)\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.13k [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.52G [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/26.0 [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/878k [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/446k [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.29M [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\n</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">No model was supplied, defaulted to facebook/bart-large-mnli (https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli)\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.13k [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.52G [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/26.0 [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/878k [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/446k [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\nDownloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.29M [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]\n</div>"]},"transient":null}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = \"\"\"\nPyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows.
